#### Bio

Hi, I'm Ben! I am a wildlife photographer, naturalist, and software engineer currently based in the Reno, NV area.

My interest in photography began in college with trips to Indonesia and Tanzania with my first camera in hand and on those trips I found a passion for photographing wildlife - particularly birds. I continued to be the designated wildlife photographer on trips with friends and family, but didn't get serious about it until I began working as a naturalist guide in Southeast Alaska on small-ship cruises with National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions in 2019. Since then I've focused on spending more time on wildlife photography on trips and at home. I am particularly interested in photographing birds and marine life and focus almost exclusively on birds when I am at home.

Before naturalist guiding and photography I focused solely on my career as a software engineer. I started my engineering career with Yelp working on geospatial and mapping systems. After several years at Yelp I joined Mapbox working as a software engineer on traffic mapping systems. Today I juggle several career interests:

* Naturalist guiding (as a contractor with [Nat Geo/Lindblad Expeditions](https://www.expeditions.com/))
* Wildlife photography (freelance)
* Software engineering & mapping (at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/))
* Machine learning & conservation science (at [Conservation Science Partners](https://www.csp-inc.org/))
