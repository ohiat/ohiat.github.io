<p>Hi, I'm Ben! I am a wildlife photographer, naturalist, and software engineer currently based in the Reno, NV area.</p>

<p>My interest in photography began in college with trips to Indonesia and Tanzania with my first camera in hand and on those trips I found a passion for photographing wildlife - particularly birds. I continued to be the designated wildlife photographer on trips with friends and family, but didn't get serious about it until I began working as a naturalist guide in Southeast Alaska on small-ship cruises with National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions in 2019. Since then I've focused on spending more time on wildlife photography on trips and at home. I am particularly interested in photographing birds and marine life and focus almost exclusively on birds when I am at home.</p>

<p>Before naturalist guiding and photography I focused solely on my career as a software engineer. I started my engineering career with Yelp working on geospatial and mapping systems. After several years at Yelp I joined Mapbox working as a software engineer on traffic mapping systems. Today I juggle several career interests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Naturalist guiding (as a contractor with Nat Geo/Lindblad Expeditions)</li>
<li>Wildlife photography (freelance)</li>
<li>Software engineering & mapping (at Mapbox)</li>
<li>Machine learning & conservation science (at Conservation Science Partners)
</ul>
